# Palmer's Penguins Streamlit App üêß ‚ùÑÔ∏è 

### This is a basic streamlit app that allows users to filter and explore the Palmer's Penguins dataset. The dataframe contains measurements collected between 2007 and 2009 on three different species of penguins living on the Palmer Archipelago in Antarctica. With 344 observations and 9 different variables, there's plenty to uncover!

To check it out, download the files in my repository and open up your Python IDE of choice. Head over to the terminal, and use the ls and cd commands to navigate your current directory to the Clark-Data-Science-Portfolio folder on your computer. For example, to enter an existing folder in your current working directory, enter "cd folder_name". To exit the folder, enter "cd ..". Once you're in the data science portfolio, enter "cd basic-streamlit-app". Then, enter "streamlit run main.py". This will open up the streamlit app in a new browser window. Happy exploring, and thank you for checking out my first streamlit app!

To see the data for yourself, you'll find it in the data folder linked [here](https://github.com/t-clark04/Clark-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/basic-streamlit-app/data). And for more information on the dataset, click [here](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/articles/intro.html)!
