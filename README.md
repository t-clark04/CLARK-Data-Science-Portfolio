# Data Science Portfolio - Tommy Clark

This repository will serve as a compilation of all data science-related projects completed over the course of the semester in MDSC 20009: Introduction to Data Science, and beyond. Projects will be grouped by their implemented techniques (i.e. machine learning, LLMs, etc.), and links to their respective repositories will be provided. Within each project repository, folders will be organized by the corresponding step in the data science workflow (i.e. EDA, data cleaning, visualization, etc.), where appropriate. A table of contents will be added once projects are begun, and the portfolio as a whole will be updated regularly.
