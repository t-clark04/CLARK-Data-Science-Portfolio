# Data Science Portfolio - Tommy Clark

This repository will compile all of my data science-related projects completed over the course of the semester in MDSC 20009: Introduction to Data Science, and beyond. Projects will be grouped by their implemented techniques (i.e. machine learning, LLMs, etc.), and links to project repositories will be provided. Within each project, folders will be organized according to the steps of the data science workflow (i.e. EDA, data cleaning, visualization, etc.), where appropriate, to make it easier to locate code of interest. A table of contents will be added here once projects are begun, and the portfolio as a whole will be updated regularly.
