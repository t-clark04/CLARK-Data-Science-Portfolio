# Data Science Portfolio - Tommy Clark

This repository will serve as a compilation of all data science-related projects completed over the course of the semester in MDSC 20009: Introduction to Data Science, and beyond. Projects will be grouped by their implemented techniques (i.e. machine learning, LLMs, etc.) and linked to their respective repositories, where you will find separate folders for each step in the data science workflow, where appropriate. A table of contents will be added once projects begin to be completed, and the portfolio as a whole will be updated regularly.
