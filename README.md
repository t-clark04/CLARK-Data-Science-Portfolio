# Data Science Portfolio - Tommy Clark

This repository will compile all of my data science-related projects completed over the course of the semester in MDSC 20009: Introduction to Data Science, and beyond. Projects will be grouped either by their implemented techniques (i.e. machine learning, LLMs, etc.) or according to the corresponding step in the data science workflow (i.e. EDA, data cleaning, visualization, etc.). Links to project repositories will be provided to make it easier to locate code of interest. Once enough projects have been completed, a table of contents will be added, and the portfolio as a whole will be updated on a regular basis.
