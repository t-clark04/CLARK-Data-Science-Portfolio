# Data Science Portfolio - Tommy Clark

This repository will compile all of my data science-related projects 💻 completed over the course of the semester in MDSC 20009: Introduction to Data Science, and beyond. Projects will be grouped either by their implemented techniques (i.e. machine learning, LLMs, etc.) or according to the corresponding step in the data science workflow (i.e. EDA, data cleaning, visualization, etc.). 📈 Links to project repositories will be provided to make it easier to locate code of interest. 🔗 Once enough projects have been completed, a table of contents will be added, and the portfolio as a whole will be updated on a regular basis.

## EDA
- [Palmer's Penguins Streamlit App 🐧❄️](https://github.com/t-clark04/Clark-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/basic-streamlit-app)
  - Basic streamlit app that allows users to filter and explore the Palmer's Penguins dataset. The dataframe contains measurements collected between 2007 and 2009 on three different species of penguins living on the Palmer Archipelago in Antarctica. Navigate over to the [basic-streamlit-app](https://github.com/t-clark04/Clark-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/basic-streamlit-app) folder for more information and for instructions on how to run the app yourself!
